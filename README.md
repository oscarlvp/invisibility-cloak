# Cloak of invisibility


This project contains a simple implementation of the [**Cloak of Invisibility**](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility) from Harry Potter. 

It is based in an original idea from @dvddarias.

A similar implementation is explained in a [Learn OpenCv blog post](https://www.learnopencv.com/invisibility-cloak-using-color-detection-and-segmentation-with-opencv/).
